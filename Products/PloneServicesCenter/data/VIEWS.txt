Basic Reports for Content

Plone.net's mission is to collect business information for decision
makers and present the information in well-organized, useful ways.  As
such, we need some views on the pile of data.

This ticket focuses on the moderate needs.  Another ticket will
collect the "wants" or "nice-to-haves".

Rating
------

The use cases below discuss "rating".  This is an field on the content
types that is only editable by reviewers.  The business purpose is to
emphasize the most useful information, from the customer's viewpoint,
ahead of the less useful.  Most evaluators would be more interested in
eBay's use than, say, Paul's Family Album.  This emphasis could mean
sorting, highlighting, or both.

Use Cases
---------

Steven is conducting a CMS evaluation for a client.  He is visiting
the website for different CMS products and trying to answer the
question: "Who is using it?"  Steven is the actor for this set of use
cases.

1) "Show me everybody using it"

This is the default view with no filters applied.  It should return a
listing with the following policies:

a. In batches of 20.

b. Sorted by "rating".

2) "Show me everybody in France".

This is an example of a filter.  The results are presented the same
way as (1).

3) "Show me all the NGO sites."

Another filter, results presented the same as (1).

4) "Show me more about this provider."

In the results, one of the site listings is interesting to Steven and
happens to have a hyperlink for the provider.  He clicks and goes to
the page for that provider.
